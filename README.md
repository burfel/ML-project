# Machine Learning Project: The Simpsons Challenge (July 2017)

During the end of the course _Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning_ we  implemented a variation of the random forest algorithm to recognise the Simpsons characters on a given data set (taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset).
